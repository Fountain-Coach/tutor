# FountainAI Tutorial Series

This repository accompanies the [FountainAI Comprehensive Tutorial Series (Beginner to Expert)](./FountainAI%20Comprehensive%20Tutorial%20Series%20(Beginner%20to%20Expert).pdf). The guides follow a template-first approach that scaffolds each project so you can focus on customizing the core FountainAI stack.

## Template-First Development

Start each tutorial from a generated template and then tailor it to your needs. This workflow encourages rapid iteration while reusing a consistent stack and enabling AI-assisted code generation.
