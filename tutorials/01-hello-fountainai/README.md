# 01 – Hello FountainAI

FountainAI is a theatre-themed Swift framework for crafting AI‑powered apps.
In this first lesson you will scaffold a tiny "Hello FountainAI" application
from the template repository. By the end you'll know how to verify your Swift
toolchain, generate the starter project, and compile and launch it locally.

Follow these steps to spin up a minimal FountainAI app.

## 1. Check your environment
Verify Swift is installed:

```bash
swift --version
```

## 2. Scaffold the app
Run the provided setup script, which pulls in the FountainAI app-creation template from the [the-fountainai](https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/the-fountainai) repo:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## 3. Build and run
Build the project and launch it locally:

```bash
swift build
swift run
```
