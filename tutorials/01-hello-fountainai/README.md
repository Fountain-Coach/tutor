# 01 – Hello FountainAI

FountainAI is a theatre-themed Swift framework for crafting AI‑powered apps.
In this first lesson you will scaffold a tiny "Hello FountainAI" application
from the template repository. By the end you'll know how to verify your Swift
toolchain, generate the starter project, and compile and launch it locally.

## Learning outcomes

By completing this tutorial, you will:

- Confirm that Swift and Git are installed and ready to use
- Scaffold a Hello FountainAI app from the official template
- Build and run the app locally, then customize its greeting

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial you'll need:

- **Swift 6.1+** – verify it is available:
  ```bash
  swift --version
  ```
- **Git 2.40+** – check with:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- **OpenAI API key** (optional but enables AI features):
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
  ```
- Make sure the setup script can run:
  ```bash
  chmod +x setup.sh
  ```

Follow these steps to spin up a minimal FountainAI app.

## Repository layout

- `tutorials/` – root folder containing all lessons in this series.
- `tutorials/01-hello-fountainai/` – files for this lesson.
  - `README.md` – step-by-step instructions (you're reading it now).
  - `setup.sh` – scaffolds the HelloFountainAI starter app.
  - `Package.swift` – Swift package manifest generated by `setup.sh`.
  - `main.swift` – entry point for the app, created by `setup.sh`.
- `Scripts/` – shared helper scripts used across tutorials.

## 1. Check your environment
Verify Swift is installed:

```bash
swift --version
```

## 2. Scaffold the app
Run the provided setup script, which pulls in the FountainAI app-creation template from the [the-fountainai](https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/the-fountainai) repo:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script clones the template repository into a temporary folder and runs its
`new-gui-app` helper to scaffold the **HelloFountainAI** target. It then copies
the generated `main.swift` and `Package.swift` into this tutorial directory and
prints status messages such as where the files were written. By default it runs
non‑interactively, so no prompts appear unless you pass a custom bundle
identifier as an argument.

## 3. Build and run
Build the project and launch it locally:

```bash
swift build
swift run
```

When the app starts successfully, the console prints a friendly greeting:

```text
$ swift run
Building for debugging...
Build complete! (0.1s)
Hello, FountainAI!
```
## Exercise: Customize the greeting

Try editing the generated `main.swift` to see how code changes affect the running program:

1. Open `main.swift` and find the line:
   ```swift
   print("Hello, FountainAI!")
   ```
2. Change the message to something unique, for example:
   ```swift
   print("Hello from my first FountainAI app!")
   ```
3. Rebuild and run the project:
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift run
   ```
The console now displays your custom greeting, demonstrating the edit-build-run cycle.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems, these tips may help:

### Swift toolchain missing
If `swift --version` or `swift build` reports `swift: command not found`, install Swift 6.1+ and ensure the `swift` binary is in your `PATH`.

### Network or Git failures
If `./setup.sh` fails to clone the template repository, verify your internet connection and that Git can reach GitHub. Retry once connectivity is restored.

### Permission denied on setup script
If the setup script isn't executable, run `chmod +x setup.sh` and try again.
