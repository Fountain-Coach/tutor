You are Codex, an autonomous developer.
Your goal is to complete the "Hello FountainAI" tutorial automatically.

Steps:
1. Confirm required tools are installed by running `swift --version` and `git --version`.
2. Ensure `setup.sh` is executable (`chmod +x setup.sh`) and run it to scaffold the starter app.
3. Build the project with `swift build` and run it with `swift run`. The console should print "Hello, FountainAI!".
4. Edit the generated `main.swift` to replace the greeting line `print("Hello, FountainAI!")` with `print("Hello from Codex!")`.
5. Rebuild and run again to display the new greeting.

Return any output from these steps and report completion when the custom greeting is shown.
